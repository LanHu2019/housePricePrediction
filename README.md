House prices tend to be spatially correlated due to similar physical features shared by neighboring houses, and their neighborhood environment. A multilevel model is one of the methodologies that has been frequently adopted to address spatial effects present in modeling house prices. Empirical studies show its capability in accounting for neighborhood specific spatial autocorrelation (SA) and analyzing potential factors related to house prices at both individual and neighborhood levels. However, a standard multilevel model specification only considers within-neighborhood SA (i.e., similar houses prices within a same neighborhood), but neglects between-neighborhood SA (i.e., more similar houses prices for adjacent than for distant neighborhoods) that can commonly exist in house prices. This incomplete accommodation of SA can lead to unreliable inference results because of overestimated significance levels for covariates and subsequently less accurate house price predictions. This project proposes an approach that extends a multilevel model using Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) methodology. This proposed model can take into account simultaneously inter-neighborhood SA with a set of Moran eigenvectors as well as potential within-neighborhood SA with a random effect term.
